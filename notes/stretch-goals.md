Figma Design for Web Layout


Let's take it a step further, how about I make a full experience LLM agent, with AI generated animations in accordance to it's responses. 

I would need to take a systematic approach. Train the LLM according to the character type I want it to resemble using OpenAI's GPT model to train it's responses.

Create multiple expressions that can be used in unreal engine or unity (never used those before)

Fine tune expression control and lip sync using Adobe Character Animator,

Implement state transitions triggered by AI responses directly in React

Perform testing.

Quite the endeavor, but sounds fun!
